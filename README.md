# RaSPr
Radiomic Survival Predictor (RaSPr) is a user-friendly tool that estimates survival risk for glioblastoma patients using advanced analysis of MRI images. By extracting and analyzing a wide range of imaging features—such as tumor shape, texture, and intensity—RaSPr provides a non-invasive way to predict patient outcomes.
